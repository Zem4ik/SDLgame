// Client TCP Connection - headerphile.com
//
// This is just as simple wrappaer around TCPsocket,it is meant to be used with NetManager
//
// It only handles cliwnt connections
// ( which means it can only be used to communicate with a server, but not accept incomming connections)
//
// It can be created by opening a connection to a remote server ( trying to connect to it )
// Or by a server when accepting a new connection. This is the result on the server side after a client tries to connect to it
